JC, this repo fixes the problems with the code you sent me. I left it mostly
unchanged other than the structural fixes. In other words, I did not change
the application at all. I just did a bit of re-organization.

The exceptions are a couple of commented lines in ``urls.py`` and some gentle
renames to conform to Python PEP8 naming standards.

Additionally I threw in some other goodies to help tame the beast.
